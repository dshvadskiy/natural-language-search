# natural-language-search

Colaboratory Labs to be used for OSC's Natural Language Search training.

## Steps:

If you don’t have one already, setup a google account to use google colaboratory!

Navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/ and press ‘Sign In’
- Create a Google account if you don’t have one
- Verify everything works by creating a new notebook
- Clone the repository here: https://github.com/o19s/natural-language-search (```git clone https://github.com/o19s/natural-language-search```)
- Navigate into the cloned ‘labs’ folder, and extract ‘tmdb.zip’
- Open your Google-drive and navitage to ‘My Drive’ → ‘Colab Notebooks’
- Upload the labs folder: press ‘New’ → ‘Upload Folder’, then select the cloned ‘labs’ folder and upload

Important note:  Depending on where you upload the folder, you’ll need to change the location of the files in some of the notebooks.  These are usually stored in a ‘path’ variable in the same block as when the google-drive content is mounted.

That’s it!
